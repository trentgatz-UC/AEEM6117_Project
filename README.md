Final project for AEEM6117

Repo for final project option 1 code & models


scrits\fuzzy_logic contains code used in "Soft Computing Based AI" course, heavily focused on fuzzy logic. It has scripts setup to run a FIS (or hFIS) and tune it via a genetic algorithm. It is not perfect, but should be easily tuneable to our problem later on.
